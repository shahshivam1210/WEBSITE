            <p>In a fundamental sense, software refers to programs that perform a particular set of tasks. A software solution is a broader term – It could encompass not just the custom code or program that’s written to accomplish particular tasks but also interact with other pieces of software, technology components, and systems.

                A software solution is typically custom-built or configured to solve a specific customer problem. It could include:</p>
            <p id="thpage">Solution Design is the first step towards the eventual physical deployment of any solution. It’s a blueprint for what needs to be built out.

                Solution Design serves as an overarching reference for the entire project setting, including the direction for and expectations from the implementation phase.
                
                As no solution can be built without proper design and architectural guidelines, the exercise of Solution Design plays a pivotal role. It lays a strong foundation for building a scalable and robust solution.</p>

            <p id="thpag">In fact, right now, pause and take a breath. Notice what’s happening. In this moment, you’re reading this article. There might be a few other things going on. Maybe you’re aware of your breathing or sounds rising and fall in your environment as you read.

                You might have few errant thoughts flitting through your mind: “What should I have for lunch?” or “I wish I slept better last night.” But that’s pretty much it. The meeting with your client hasn’t happened yet and the argument with your sister is over. It sounds reductive, but right now nothing bad is likely happening to you.Being more fully present can solve a lot of our problems. Of course, there are productive and necessary ways to think about an upcoming meeting or reflect on a sibling rivalry.

                The other day I was wrestling with a worry. As I observed my thoughts go round and round like Ferris wheel, I shifted my attention to the flowers outside my window. Grabbing a pair of clippers, I headed out the door and into the garden. I kneeled down in front of a clump of hydrangea and started deadheading. As I took in the fading pink blossoms, smelled the damp earth and narrowed my focus to snip the stems at just the right spot, my worry evaporated in the evening dew.</p>
